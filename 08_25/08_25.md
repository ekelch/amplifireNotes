## Stand Up

### Brandon
- Reviewing most of old classes, besides maybe errors
- Started project, didn't get terribly far but it's ready to work on now
- Tried to set up the pom file, lots of red, needs to fix errors.

### Evan
- Trouble with following structure of code.
- Needs to rewatch lecture for database connections
- Blockers: Code is simple but organization is complicated; needs to understand DAO and systems and repos...etc...

### Willie
- Downloaded maven and started to initialize project
- If he has any troubles he will reach out to the team

### Sho
- Yesterday rewatched Tuesday lectures, followed the setup for maven and get it setup properly
- Parents anniversary today so not terribly inclined to put in work today
- Expects lots of work Friday and this weekend

### Patch
- Needs to see whole picture and work on organization
- Understand what classes and their relationship before coding, wrote them all down
